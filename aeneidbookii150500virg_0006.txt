 

Ruins os Anu-ient Troy.

‘⁶ Ο lamentable fall of famous towne,
Which raignd so many years victorious,
And of all Asie bore the soveraine crowne,
In ono sad night consumd and thr-owen downe!
Whan stony hart, that beares thy haplesse fate,
IS not empicrst with deep emnpassiowne,
And makes ensanmle of man's wretched state,
Thau flowers so fresh ab morne, and fades ab evening late !”
SPENSER, Faerz'e Queene.
