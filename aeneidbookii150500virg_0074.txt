70 MATRICULATION LATIN.

433. vitavisse: the subject, me, left to be gathered from the
context, as often in poetry (514. x). vices: ‘enoount-ers' (i.e.‚
changing blows), or ‘chances of war‚’ are both possible renderings.
Danaum: with both tela and vice& [Others connect it w. manu,-
cf. 1. 383.]

434. ut caderem: better taken with si sata fzciseent (equivalent
to a verb of determining) than with merui-§se (522. c). divellimur:
‘ we tear ourselves‚’ middle or reflexive use (656. iv).

436. gravior: ‘burdened,' the comparative having really an
intensive force (593. iii). tardus: ‘stiffi’ ‘crippled.' Ulixi: sub-
jective genitive, ‘ dealt by ' (429. c).

437. vocati: agreeing with the subject of divellimur. clamore:
‘ by the shouting‚' not ‘ with shouts.’

438-452. A: Priam’s palaea Aeneas finde α sterce struyyle qoiny
on, the Greeks tryiny zo scale the battlements and to force the doore,
the Trojans resistiny.

438. vero: indicating that something important is to be told,
that some crisis has been reached; cf. ll. 105 and 309. pugnam:
depending on cernimus, l. 441. nusquam: ‘ no where else‚’ that
is, the struggle here is so intense that it seems impossible there
should be any left to fight elsewhere.

439. forent: the imperf. subj. of sum has also forem, fores, foret
and forent for essem, etc. For the mood see 566. nulli: ‘no othere.'

440. sie: looking back to ceu . . . urbe; omitin trans. Martem
indomitum: ‘a stubborn fight‚' repeating the idea of inyemem
puynam, after the parenthesis

441. acta testudine: ‘ under cover of a roos of shields‚' lit. ‘ the
testudo being advanced.’ The cover of overlapping shields re-
sembled a tortoise-shell. Tennyson probably had this passage in

mind when he wrote:

“ Heroes tall,
Dislodging pinnacle and parapet.
Upon the tortoise creeping to the wall.''

The assault is two-sold: an attempt to scale the walls, 442-449,
458-4ss8; and an attempt to force the gates, 449-450, 469-485.
The former is referred to in the words ad tecta ruentes, the latter
in the words obses-Qum . . . limen.
