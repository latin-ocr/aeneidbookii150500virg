81. fando: ‘in conversation,' ‘by report,’ cf. l. 6. aliquod
nomen: ¹ some mention of Palamedes’ name.’ pervenit: by using
the introductory ‘ there‚’ the two subjects noman and (storia may
be brought in later.

82. Belidae: descent and relationship may be indicated by
patronymica, having the suffixes -acles or -ialva These are Greek
masculine nouns of the first declensiom of which the gen. sing.
and nom. plur. end in -ιιε, Palamedis: Ulysses had feigned
madness that he might escape taking part in the war. Palamedes
by an adroit trick had shown that the madness was merely a
pretence. This aroused Ulysses' resentment, and he compassed
Palamedes' downfall by hiding a letter from Priam and some
gold in Palamedes’ tent and then falsely accusing him of treason
to the Greeks. Palamedes was also a great inventor, and some
think that Ulysses was jealous of his reputation sor shrewdness.
incluta: ‘spread abroad; ² nom. case, with yloria. fama: abl.

84. The recurrence of the syllable in is doubtless intentional.
vetabat: the indicative shows< that this was the real not the
alleged reason (640). This crafty touch would all the more win
the sympathy of the Trojans for Palamedes and his attendant
Sinon. For the tense see 678. b.

‘bereft of light‚’ ie, (lead (437); with quem repeated, ‘but whom.’

dependant, and thus to show that he had not come against Troy
of his own will. in arma : ‘ for warfare.’ primis ab annis: ‘ from
my (not the war’s) earliest years.' Hence huc misit must be used
in a pregnant sense, which may be expressed by using two verbs,
‘to him my father a-ssiffloed me, ete, from my earliest years», and
senc me hither.' For one indication of Sinon's age, see l. 138.
M isit can mean only virtually sent‚—that was what his act led to.
[Some think that Sinon was really a mere lad ten years before, and
that Virgil in l. 138 is guilty of an inconsistency.]
