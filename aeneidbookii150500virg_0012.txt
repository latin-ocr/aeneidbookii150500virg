reared by a shepherd. When he grew up he was very
beautiful, though rather effeminate, and was at last recognized
and reinstated in his rights as the king’s son.

But before this last event, a very notable thing had hap-
pened. At a certain wedding feast, at which most of the gods
and goddesses were present, one who had not been invited, the
goddess of Discord, avenged the slight by sending a golden
apple inscribed “To the Fairest.’' Three 'goddesses claimed
it, Juno, Minerva and Venus. The decision was referred to
Paris, then a shepherd on Mount Ida. To win his verdict,
J uno promised him power, Minerva wisdom, and Venus the
fairest woman in Greece as his wife. Paris awarded the apple
to Venus and not long after went to Greece. There he fell in
love with the most beautiful woman of those days, Helen, the
wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta. Her beauty had caused
many princes to sue for her hand in marriage, and before a
choice was made they had all sworn to avenge any wrong that
might ever be done to her. So now when Paris induced her to
fiee with him to Troy, Menelaus had no difficulty in getting a
large number of kings with their warriors to assist him in
recovering Helen and punishing Paris.

Under the leadership of Agamemnon, brother of Menelaus
and king of Mycenae, a fleet of nearly twelve hundred ships
gathered at Aulis to set sail against Troy. Here they were
long detained by calms or contrary winds sent by the goddess
Artemis, whom king Agamemnon had once displeased. The
oraeles declared that only by sacrifieing Iphigenia, the maiden
daughter of the king, to Artemis, could the‘Greeks obtain
favoring winds, and reluctantly at length Agamemnon sent for
his daughter. Now at last the great host could set sail from
Greece. The most famous among the Greeks, besides Aga-
memnon and Menelaus, were Achilles, the grandest warrior of
the age, Ulysses who, whilea great warrior, was specially noted
for his shrewdness, and Diomedes and Ajax.
