realization ot the scene which must have been in his mind. On the other
hand, the description of Virgil does not appear to be derived directly
from the group made by Agesander and his colleagues.. It is by the suc—
cession of the narrative, as Lessing points out, that the poet attains his
effect, not by an elaborate description of the pose of his subjects at any
dramatic moment. The awful approach ot the serpents across the sea,
their first attack on the two children, and their· turning to Laocoon him-
self, when he rushes to the aid of his sons, cannot find any expression in
sculpture, though on these things the pathos and terror of the poetical
description mainly depend. But when we turn to the group itsclf, we
cannot help feeling that the object of the sculptor was not so much to
express in marble the story of Laocoon as to make use of the theme as a
pretext for a group of figures· struggling in the agony of a cruci death.”
