expressive of something solemn or stately. Alliteration is also
a very frequent device of Virgil's.

The following irregularities occur ε

Ι. Many of Virgil's lines are unfinished, though conforming
sofar as they go to the regular metre. While in some cases
these half lines may be intentional or very expressive of cer-
tain pathetic emotions, it is possible that Virgil in his final
revision would have altered them. As it is, his finer taste pre-
ferred an incomplete line to one padded out with weak additions.

2. Occasionally, i before a vowel is given the sound of the
semi-vowel y ,· e.g., abiete is prononnced abyele, three syllables
instead of four. In such cases the y sound counts as a conso-
nant in making position. This shortening is called Synaeresis.

3. Syllables regularly long are sometimes shmtened, chiefly
in the ending -eruut of the perfect indic. active, and in the
ending -ius of the gen. sing. This is calleci Systole.

4. Α final syllable regularly short is sometimes lengthened.
This lengthening (which is called Diastole) occurs only in the
first syllable of a foot and generally at the caesural pause.
In almost every case the syllable was originally long.

5. It is the exception for a line to end in a monosyllable.
This occurs generally where some earlier Latin poet is imitated,
or where the sense corresponds to the abrupt ending.

6. Sometimes the fifth foot is a spondee, chiefly to express
a slow measured movement, ‘or impressive act, or in Greek
proper names. A line of this sort is calleci Spondaic.

7. In a few cases a superfluous syllable (generally que) is
found at the end of a line, regularly where there could be an
elision with the first word of the next line. Such a case is
called H ypermeter or Synapheia.

8. Sometimes where there is a decided pause in the sense, or
with Greek proper names, elision does not occur. This non-
elision is called H iabus.
