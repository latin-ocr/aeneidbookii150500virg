the interweaving of the old and ever new themes of war and
sea-adventures, with the passion of love.

Virgil's restoration of the legendary past is not exact in all
its details, or sometimes even in its spirit. There is a mixture
of primitive simplicity and luxurious pomp, of the fierceness

the most exquisite finish. But what Virgil has in a. degree that
no other poet has ever equalled is pity ; the sense of “bears in
