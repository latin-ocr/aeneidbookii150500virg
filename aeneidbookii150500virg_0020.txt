16 MATRICULATION LATIN.

V. —THE METRE OF THE AENEID.

The principle upon which rhythm is based in English poetry
is a regular succession of accented and unaccented syllables.
In Latin, accent has nothing to do with scansion, which
depends rather on the regular succession of long and short
syllables

LONG AND SHORT SYLLABLES.

A long syllable is one containing a long vowel, or a diph-
thong,* or even a short vowel before two consonants, ors, α), or
ε,- aq. the first syllable in each of the following words is
long: primus, aedes, mentis, major, texo„ qaza. Even if one
of the two consonants be at ‘the beginning of another word
’ this rnle holds, aq. the syllable 5·sz is short in sub ipsa, but
long in sub montem. But the rule does not always hold when
the two consonants arel or r preceded by some other letter;
e. 9. the first syllable of patris may be short or long.

A short syllable is one containing a short vowel (except in
the cases mentioned in th} preceding paragraph), including
regularly all cases where a vowel is followed by another vowel
or diphthong, e. q. the first syllable in tenet, deus, deae, is
short. But genitives in ins have i sometimes short sometimes
long, and niany proper names, borrowed from the Greek (in
which this rnle does not hold) have a lon g vowel before another
vowel or diph thong, eff. the second syllable of Aeneas, Orion.

ln scansion h is not considered, so that the first syllable of
adhuc is not long, while in milli the first syllable is short as
certainly as if it were spel led mii.

Syllables then may be short or long either by nature or by
position.

*The only diphthongs in Latin are ae, au, en. ei, oe and ui, the two
first being far the commonest.
