in the world. Aeneas in ancient times and Augustus in
his own day are regarded as instruments in the hands of fate,
which is a great inscrutable power working out its purposes
in the world through the agency of Rome.

With this idea of universal empire is combined a reverence
for antiquity‚ for old customs, for the religious saith of early
Italy, and an attachment to all places connected with the his-
tory of the nation.

The Aeneid then, as an epic describing the great part Rome
played in the history of· the world, as determined by the divine
decrees, is partly a national and partly a religious epic. It
has only a secondary interest as an epic of human action, as
a portrayal of manners and character, and it has always been
objected to the Aeneid that its central character is 3 failure—
that while Aeneas is blameless, piens, and patient, he 15 unin-
teresting, weak, lacking in energy, that 113 15 3 passive tool in
the hands of fate, not a great hero rel ying upon his own
resources and stirred by ordinary human passions. It may be
that Virg'il was determined in this largely by his weariness of
the civil wars that had been raging so long, and by the desire
felt everywhere in his days for the restoration of peace, law,
order and piety. This desire was met by Augustus’ policy,
and in this lay the security of Augustus' position.

Dido stands out as the most life—like and interesting charac-
ter Virgil has drawn, and even if she does represent to the
Roman the hated race of Carthaginians, and even if her deser-
tion by Aeneas calls forth no hint of c‹2›n‹le1nnation from the
poet, we cannot but feel that Virgil sympathetically entered
into the tragic nature of Dido’s story.

Apart from character the main sources of human interest
developed in the Aeneid are: the nobility and dignity of the
story itself, apart from its connection with the national senti-
ment3 the interest of two romantio legends, the destruction of
Troy, and the foundation of Carthage; the scenes familiar,
yet fun oi great memories and associations; the characters
