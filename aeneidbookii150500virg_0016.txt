IV.—THE AENEID OF VIRGIL.

The Aeneid belongs to the class of poetry called Epic. that
is, it is a narrative poem, of an elevated character, describing
the exploits of heroes.

The following, condensed from Sellar, gives a general
account of Virgil's position and excellence as a poet.

There was before Virgil's time but one Roman Epic, the
Annals of Ennius, written two hundred years before, stirring
but rugged3 about the time when Virgil first came to Rome
the poems of Lucretius and Catullus appeared, which were the
most artistic in form yet written in Rome. A Roman epic
was wanted which would satisfy the national imagination as
Ennius did, and also the new sense of art, and the great expan-
sion of national life since Ennius' day. The emperor Augustus
was anxious that his exploits should be commemorated by
some great poet, and virgil had long been ambitious to treat
the traditions of Alba Longa in heroic verse.

These objects then had to be kept in view—a work ot art
that could rival the great epics of Homer 3 a revival of interest
in the heroic legends concerning the founding of Rome; the
expression of the national feeling of an imperial city3 the
expression of the deeper feelings and thoughts of his age about
the ideals and the problems of life3 and the celebration of
Augustus. All these Virgil combined by selecting the story
of Aeneas, which enabled him to treat of the origin of Rome,
to parallel Homer's tales of war and sea-wanderings, and to
glorify the family of the Caesars, the Julii, who boasted ot
their descent from Iulus the son of Aeneas.

As regards Rome itself, Virgil develops the conception
entertained by the Romans themselves, that their city was
ordained by Heaven to achieve world-wide dominion. Thus
Virgil represents Aeneas as guided continually by the gods
until he founds the city, destined by the {ates to be the greatest
