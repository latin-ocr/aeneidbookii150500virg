lO MATRICULATION LAT1N.

In this war the gods took part, some, like Juno, Neptune,
Pallas and Apollo, savoring the Greeks, others, like Venus and.
Mars, aiding Troy, though the latter were unable to prevail
over the destiny decreed by fate for Priam and his city.

Aeneas escaped from the burning town and with some fol„
lowers sailed away under the special protection of his mother,
Venus, to found a new city. After many disappointments
and wonderful adventures he landed in Italy, and from the
settlement he planted there grew the great city of Rome, that

in Virgil’s day had become the mistress of the whole civilized
world. The adventures and experiences of Aeneas form the
subject of the poem called the Aeneid.

IL—LIFE OF VIRGIL.

Publius Vergilius* Maro was born B.C. 70 at the little vil-
lage of Andes near Mantua, in the great northern plain of
Italy, watered by the river Padus, the modern Po. The people
of this country were of Gallie descent and not close kinsmen of
the Romans or southern Italians, and it was not till Virgil
was twenty-one years of age that they were made full Roman
citizens. Virgil’s father lived on a small farm, but was able
to give his son all the advantages of education to be obtained
in those days, perhaps seeing early in his boy some signs of
future greatness. Except that Virgil studied in Cremona and
Milan and at sixteen was sent to Rome to the best teachers
there, we know practically nothing of his youth. This period
fell between the two great civil wars of Rome, and from what
we know of Virgil’s nature, the comparative peace of his boy-
hood and youth was more congenial to him than the civil wars
that raged from his twenty-second to his fortieth year.
