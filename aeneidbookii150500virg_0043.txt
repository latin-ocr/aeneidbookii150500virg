In the seventh year after the fall of Troy, Aeneas with his band
of exiles is still wandering over the sea in search of his destined
home. Driven by a storm to the coast of Africa, he comes to
Carthage, which Queen Dido and a band of fugitives from Tyre
had recently built. By her the Trojans are graciously welcomed,
and in the 'eveninga banquet is given in honor of Aeneas in Dido's
palace. At this banquet the queen asks her guest to tell her the
story of his country's fall and his long wanderings. Such is the
substance of the first book of the Aeneid; the second and third
books give the story told by Aeneas in answer to Queen Dido's
request, while the remaining nine books contain the rest of Aeneas’
