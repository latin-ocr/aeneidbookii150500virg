INTRODUCTION To VIRGIL. 15

(Aen. 1. 462) he has given imperishable expression, and which
fius with strange insighb and. profound emotion ‘chose lonely
words and. pathetio half lines where he has sounded the depths
of beauty and sorrow, of patiecco and magnanimity, of honor
in life and hope beyond death. ’

 

Perhaps nothing so completely expresses the modern view
οἱ virgil as the lines of Tennyson (himself the mosb Virgilian
013 all our modern poets)‚vwritten ab the request of the people
of Manbua for the nineteenth oentenary of Virgil's death,
1881.

Roman VirgiL thou that singest. Ilion's lofty temples robed in fire,

Ilion falling, Rome arising, wars, and filial saith, and Dido’s pyreq

Landscape-lover‚101·(l ot language more than he that sang the &Vorks
and Day s,

All the chosen coin of fancy flashing out from many a golden phrase:

Thou that singest u heat and w oodland, tilth and vineyard, h1ve .nd

. horse and liei d3

All the charm of all the Muses often flowering in a lonely word ς

Poet of the happy Tityrus piping underneath his beechen bowers :

Poet of the poet-satyr whom the laughing shepherd bound with flowers ς

Chanter of the Pollio, glorying in the blissful years again to be,

Summers ofthe snakeless meadom unlaborious earth and oarless sea:

Thou that seest Universal Nature moved by Universal Mind ς

Thou majestie in thy sadness at the doubtful doom of human kind ς

Light among the vanished ages ς star that gildest yet this phantom
shore ;

Golden branch amid the shadows‚ kings and realms that pass to rise no
more ς

Now thy Forum roars no longer3 fallen every purple Caesar‘s dome—

Tho' thine ocean-roll of rhythm sound for ever of Imperial Rome-

Now the Rome of slaves hath perish'd‚ and the Rome of freemen holds
her place ς

Ι, from out the Northern Island‚ sunder⁷d once from all the human race,

I salute thee, Mantovano, I that loved thee since my day began,

Wielder of the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man.
