INTRODUCTION 'ro vtaen„ 9

For nine long years the siege went on. Many cities in Asia
sent forces to Troy to aid Priam, whose best warriors were his
son Hector and Aeneas, the latter being the son of Venus and
a Trojan prince, Anchises. The Greeks did not surround the
city, but encamped on the shore near their ships, and many
battles took place on the plain before Troy. In these'nine
years the Greeks succeeded in driving the Trojans within the
walls and in gaining the surrounding towns.

In the tenth year a notable quarrel arose between Aga-
memnon and Achilles, and for a time, while Achilles held aloof
from fighting, the Trojans had the better of it. Emboldened
by success they fought their way to the Grecian fleet drawn up
on the shore, and had well-nigh set the ships on fire when
Patroclus, the bosom friend of Achilles, begged him, if he
would not fight himself, at least to lend his armor and his
warriors to repel the enemy. Achilles consented, and Patroclus,
driving back the Trojans, saved the ships but was himself
slain by Hector and stripped of Achilles' armor. Impelled by
rage and grief, Achilles now returned to the battle to avenge
the death of his friend. At his approach the Trojans, with
the one exception of Hector, fled back to their walls3 and him
Achilles soon slew. Then tying Hector’s body by the feet to
his chariot hc dragged him to the Grecian camp. It was not
long, however, before Achilles himself was slain by Paris, and
then, in obedience to the oracles, his son Pyrrhus (or
Neoptolemus) was brought to the scene of war.

But When nothing seemed to bring them success, the Greeks
tried. stratagem, and pretended to sail away homewards,
leaving a huge wooden horse as an offering to Minerva. This
the Trojans drew, rejoicing, within their walls, bnt within it
were concealed many of the bravest Greeks, who issued from
the horse by night, seized the gates and, aided by the other
Greeks, who had returned in the fleet, took the city and
destroyed it.
