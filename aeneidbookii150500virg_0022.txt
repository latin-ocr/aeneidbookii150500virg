ι18 MATRICULATION LATIN.

may be marked off ; then the quantity of syllables long or
short by position, as determined by the preceding rules, can be
marked ; after which the first four feet can, in a large majority
of cases, be easily settled. Finally (and this is all-important,
if the studentis ever to get beyond this rule of thumb and
catch the rhythm of Virgil), the line when scanned should be
read over according to the division made.

CAESURA,

then a word ends within a foot, a caesura is said to occur,
and in the clactylic hexameter, the caesura or caeeural pauca,
when it coincides with a pause in the sense, constitutes much
of the charm of the rhythm, the line thus falling into two
unequal parts.

The favorite caesural pause occurs in the third foot, but·
sometimes it comes in the fourth foot, in which case there is
often another pause in the second foot, the line thus being
divided into three parts,

The pause is far more often after the long syllable of a.
dactylic foot than after the first short syllable*

SPECIAL FEATCRES ΛΝΒ IRREGCLARITIES.

Because of the variety of rhythm possible, this metre affords
great possibilities of imitative harmony; excited, or rapid
action being often expressed in a line where dactyls abound,
and solemn or gloomy ideas, stately or majestic movements,
and slow or difficult actions brought out by a line abounding
in spondeos. It should be noticed, however, that the Latin
language is naturally more spondaic than dactylic in its
ordinary movement (stately and sonorous rather than lively),
and a succession of spondees does not seem to be always
